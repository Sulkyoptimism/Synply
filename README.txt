Synply v0.1a

To open run start.bat.
*You may have to allow priviledges then add an exception and restart the program by closing all windows*

Will open text documents as inputs, I imagine it will use your default text editor so VScode or sublime might work well here.

To start the playback ctrl + s, save the Alda input and it should start playing, 
feel free to mess about with everything however it is still VERY limited in features, 
the basic functionality is essentially already written down in the demos for you already.
It wont support multiple instruments as of yet.

It should update in real time as you play, there is also keyboard input which i left in for testing.

Any errors or bugs please try to report them in a log file and send the file to me.
